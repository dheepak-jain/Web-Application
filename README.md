These are the projects that I have done during my internship at Zoho WSM.

What is a Event?                      
An event is an action that occurs as a result of the user or another source.

What is Channel?    
A channel is a named stream of events that transports events from an event publisher to an event log file, 
where an event consumer can get an event.

Event Log Collector (It is similar to Windows event Log viewer) is an application that shows information about records of system, security and application notifications stored 
by the Windows operating system that can be used by administrators to diagnose system problems and predict future issues.

Channel Information is an application which displays the channels that are present in the system.
